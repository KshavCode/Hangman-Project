## File Info
`Improved` folder contains the latest version of Hangman, created using less code and runs efficiently in both terminal and GUI wise. Outside this folder is the original version which was created back in 2023-24 with a lot of complex code since I had to create however I could.\n`Improved/images` contains the images of stickman which is used to represent the number of lives left for guessing the word. The stickman is only for the GUI version.
